# gnss2tws
GNSS2TWS is an open-source Matlab tool for inferring daily terrestrial water storage changes using GNSS vertical data


# Attribution
The primary purpose of this code is to allow the inversion of time series of surface vertical displacement for daily terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes in a specific study area. We assume that the potential users are familiar with the Matlab language programming, PCA decomposition, inversion method, and mass loading theory. The code has been written in MATLAB (version 2018b) and has been tested on Windows (version 10) operating systems.

Readers can download the complete software (including the code and one example (all input/output data)) from the GPS Toolbox website (https://geodesy.noaa.gov/gps-toolbox/gnss2tws.shtml) and we also release this open-source tool (including the code and one example (all input data)) on GitHub (https://github.com/jzshhh/gnss2tws). Readers need to decompress the code into a local folder and decompress the file 'gnss.zip' in the folder 'data/' to run this example. There are no additional requirements except for the MATLAB language running environment.
